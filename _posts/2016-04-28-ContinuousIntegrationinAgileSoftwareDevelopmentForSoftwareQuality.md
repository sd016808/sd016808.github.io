For a decade or more, software teams have benefited from agile development methods. They have adopted these iterative and incremental development practices, where solutions evolve through collaborative development. Traditional, non-agile approaches to creating software typically rely on a more regimented flow of development. An example of this is the waterfall process, where each activity of requirements, design, development, and testing is done serially.

Although waterfall development was the standard for large, complex system development for many years, it has several notable flaws. The first is that a lot of work is wasted trying to complete documents before designs and designs before code, even though it is well known that the requirements will change over time. Another is that, in holding off on testing and integration until the end of a project, issues are frequently discovered too late to be resolved without causing missed deadlines. These two factors, combined, might have been tolerable in a world that moved at a slower pace. But as the pressure to create innovative systems has increased, the ability of that approach to meet the needs of organizations has decreased.

Even though they were popularized by teams developing IT systems, agile practices can apply equally well to product development where the product consists of hardware, electronics, and software. Embedded software development differs from IT application development primarily in the limited availability of deployment target resources, such as processor performance and memory. Embedded software often performs complex real-time operations in these constrained conditions. Think about a computer-controlled system like the airbags in your car. You need them to deploy immediately, but you also need them to deploy reliably. The agile methods were originally designed for smaller, co-located project teams in unregulated industries. It took many years for them to be stretched so that the agile approach could accommodate larger, more complex development projects.


When applied as part of an architecture-based approach, continuous integration (CI) and test-driven development (TDD) extend basic agile practices enough to provide both high quality and project flexibility. This article explores how agile methods, CI, and TDD can be employed in the context of embedded software development. It also describes the benefits of this combination.

## Summary ##

From a technical perspective, CI helps teams work more efficiently. These teams can be cross-functional, creating hardware and software that works together. They can be geographically distributed, because the constant integration work will ensure that you don't get deviating designs. People can work on a large team, because the different components of a complex system will more assuredly work together. It solves many of the early pitfalls that these nontraditional agile teams might have experienced without CI. Combining CI with test-driven development puts more people under the agile umbrella, because it allows agile methods to work more efficiently.
From a business perspective, CI offers better business results by allowing teams to have their cake and eat it too. That is, they can bring products to market faster, by finding issues when they are young and small, not waiting until they are large and more difficult to fix. They can also respond better to requirements that are introduced while the product is being development. This creates a better product for the customer, which is the real promise of agility.
